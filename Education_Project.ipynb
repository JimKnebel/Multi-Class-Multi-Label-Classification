    "The current notebook showcases my current ability in machine learning as well as serves as a playground for trying out new concepts. This means the notebook is updated frequently while being improved on in the background. I will aim to swiftly weave my thought processes in between the lines of code using the text blocks (such as this one) to give insight into my current knowledge and reasoning."

The aim of the competition is to help schools correctly identify spending labels (previously done manually) based mostly on a large set of text features. The project is a supervised multi-class multi-label classification problem where the resulting machine is able to predict the most probable spending label for any new instance."

    "I am very happy to see a working model with an accuracy of around 90% on the test set. Of course, the model can be improved on by including extra steps in the pipeline like polynomial features and parameter tuning. Due to the nature of this model being quite complex (multi-class/multi-label) and having a considerably sized dataset I chose to simplify the model to not make it too time-consuming to execute. I tried using dimensionality reduction to reduce the execution time, however doing so dropped the accuracy of the model by a large amount (40%). If I had the time and/or computational power I would have tried out more models. Even though this was a quick exercise, I am pleasantly surprised that an almost bare Logistic Regression works reasonably well even without additional tools.\n",

    "I was worried running a cross-validation test in a multi-class multi-label classification machine might cause issues. Similar to why we used multilabel_train_test_split over the regular train_test_split: you want each class to be present in both the train and test data. I assumed the cross validation wouldn't be able to properly handle the sparse labels. It could be that the 'mishandling of multi labeled data' only affected the least common examples in the dataset and therefore does little to influence the performance of the overall machine and goes unnoticed. As such it would be a good idea to also look into the performance of the model on less frequent examples."
